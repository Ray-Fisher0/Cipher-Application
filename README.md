# Overview

This Cipher Application provides an interactive way to encrypt and decrypt text using multiple different encryption techniques such as the Ceasar, Reverse, and Playfair Cipher.
It was designed to demonstrate understanding of:
  * Algorithm design
  * Encryption Algorithms
  * Optional file input/output automation
  * Tabs and Tkinter Application Format
  * Text manipulation

## Features

Give a random starting shift amount that can be changed to encrypt and decrypt text for Caesar Cipher  

Encrypt and decrypt messages with selected cipher method changed through tabs

Choose between manual input or text files and be able to save output to new text files

Handle both uppercase and lowercase letters along with nonalphabetic character if so chosen

Clear user interface for command-line operation

## Ciphers Implemented:

  * Caesar Cipher 
  * Playfair Cipher
  * Reverse Cipher
