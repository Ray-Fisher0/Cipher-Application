# Overview

This Cipher Application provides an interactive way to encrypt and decrypt text using multiple encryption techniques.
It was designed to demonstrate understanding of:
  * Text manipulation
  * Algorithm design
  * Encryption Algorithms
  * Optional file input/output for automation

## Features

* Give a random starting shift amount that can be changed to encrypt and decrypt text
* Encrypt and decrypt messages with selected cipher method
* Choose between manual input or text files
* Handle both uppercase and lowercase letters along with nonalphabetic character if so chosen
* Clear user interface for command-line operation

## Cipher Used to Implement:

  Caesar Cipher with random amount of shifting
